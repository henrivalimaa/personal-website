								<b>How</b> I've became a web developer was an fortunate accident. Few years ago I partnered with a company named <a>Almerin</a>. We were funded by EU coverment and our solution was <a>YipTree PLE</a>. I worked there as an full-stack developer and a system architect. Last year I moved to marketing and sales to improve our distribution inside of European Union borders.

							<b>Web</b> design and app development have been my passion for few years now. I've been practising my skills towards latest technologies and frameworks. Lately I've been focusing on front-end design and development. As you can see my toolbox contains several tools which can be used in modern web application development. I'm also capable of working in service and business logic layer so that I can call myself a full-stack de developer in a mean.
